## 2026-04-25 - Frontend stack setup verification and stabilization

### The Change
- Verified [package.json](/d:/projects/Cora/apps/web/package.json) includes the agreed non-optional frontend stack for Solana:
  - `next`, `react`, `react-dom`
  - `framer-motion`
  - `@solana/web3.js`
  - `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`
  - `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`
  - `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`
  - `@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom`
  - `@coral-xyz/anchor`
  - `@tanstack/react-query`
- Confirmed the install avoids `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets` to prevent the prior Windows install failure path.

### The Reasoning
- We aligned the web stack to Solana-first requirements (Phantom + Devnet flow) instead of EVM tooling.
- We used explicit wallet adapter packages (especially Phantom) for tighter dependency control and improved install reliability on Windows.

### The Tech Debt
- Wallet support is currently Phantom-focused; if multi-wallet support is needed later, we should add adapters incrementally and verify Windows compatibility package by package.
- We still need implementation wiring for `ConnectionProvider` + `WalletProvider` and environment-based RPC config for Devnet.
